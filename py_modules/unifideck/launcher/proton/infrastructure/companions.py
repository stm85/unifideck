"""launcher/proton/infrastructure/companions.py — extra exes alongside a game.

Lets a game launch bring along "companion executables" — trainers, cheat
tools, or any other utility the user attaches via the "Companion
executables" picker — in the SAME Proton prefix/env as the main game,
without touching Steam's launch options or ``%command%`` at all (the
CheatDeck approach this replaces edits ``PROTON_REMOTE_DEBUG_CMD`` into
the shortcut's Launch Options, which both breaks the ``store:game_id``
argv the dispatcher depends on and requires a "skip launcher check"
workaround for stores where the game's own exe is itself a launcher).

A companion is spawned by invoking Proton's OWN ``proton`` script directly
with the ``runinprefix`` verb — deliberately NOT through ``umu-run`` (the
wrapper the main game uses). ``umu-run`` builds a brand-new
pressure-vessel/bwrap container sandbox on EVERY invocation, even when
``WINEPREFIX``/``STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH`` are identical to an already-running
game's. Two separate sandboxes leave the companion's ``OpenProcess`` call
against the main game's PID denied ("Address not found. Reason: Access
Denied.", the FLiNG-trainer error observed on-device) even though both wine
clients share the same prefix, because process/ptrace visibility is scoped
per-sandbox, not per-prefix.

This mirrors ``protontricks-launch --no-bwrap`` — the community-documented,
working way to inject a trainer into an already-running Proton game — which
also calls ``proton`` directly rather than going through any container
wrapper, landing the companion in the SAME namespace as the launcher process
(and thus the same one the main game's ``umu-run`` invocation is a
descendant of), with visibility into the main game's process tree. See
``proton``'s own source (the ``runinprefix`` verb: just
``run_proc([wine_bin] + argv)``, no container, no wineserver wait) for why
this specific verb was chosen over ``run``/``waitforexitandrun`` — see
:func:`start_companions` for why ``waitforexitandrun``, the main game's own
verb, would otherwise deadlock a companion in an already-occupied prefix.

The env is the plan's ``env`` copied verbatim (same ``WINEPREFIX``,
``STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH``, etc., so it lands in the exact same wine
environment) with ``PROTON_VERB`` set to ``runinprefix`` — every other var
matches the main game's, per the umu-launcher FAQ's rule for running a
second process in an already-occupied prefix. Companions are fire-and-forget:
a failure to spawn or a nonzero exit is logged and toasted, never raised, so
a broken trainer can never fail or block the actual game launch.

``CompanionSupervisor`` owns the lifecycle: :func:`start_companions`
schedules each entry (respecting its configured delay) as a background
asyncio task and returns a supervisor; the caller stops it — cancelling
any not-yet-started delay and killing every process group already
spawned — once the main game exits (see
``services.launcher.orchestrator``).

    NOT a real Steam shortcut appid — never written to shortcuts.vdf and
    never surfaced to Steam's library. It exists purely so the companion's
    window can be tagged with a ``STEAM_GAME`` X11 property distinct from
    the main game's real appid (see ``gamescope_window_tagger``'s module
    docstring): gamescope's focus picker treats each distinct ``STEAM_GAME``
    value as its own focusable app, but paints only ONE top-level window per
    value — tagging a companion with the SAME value as the main game made
    the trainer's window simply never get painted while the game's window
    (mapped first) held that slot, only appearing once the game's window
    unmapped on exit. A companion gets its own dedicated value instead, so
    gamescope treats it as a genuinely separate app, reachable independently
    via the Steam button's app switcher.

    Deterministic (CRC32 of ``f"{game_key}|{companion_path}"``) so the same
    companion is tagged identically across repeated launches without
    needing to persist anything.

    Constrained to the POSITIVE signed-32-bit range (``0x40000000`` ..
    ``0x7FFFFFFF``): an earlier revision forced the HIGH bit on
    (``| 0x80000000``) to keep clear of real low-valued appids, but that
    yields values above 2^31 which read as NEGATIVE when interpreted as a
    signed ``int32`` — and gamescope/steamcompmgr handles appids as signed
    ints in places (``get_prop`` returns into signed types, ``w->appID``
    comparisons). On-device that manifested as the companion's window not
    being composited AT ALL (worse than merely being hidden behind the
    game), which is exactly what happened when this fake appid was first
    tried. Forcing bit 30 instead keeps the value comfortably positive
    while still landing far above any real Steam appid (>1 billion), so it
    can't collide with the main game's own.
