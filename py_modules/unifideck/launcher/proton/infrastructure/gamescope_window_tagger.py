"""Tag game windows with STEAM_GAME so gamescope brings them to the foreground.

umu's own ``monitor_windows`` does this, but only when ``is_steammode`` is
True — which requires ``container=flatpak``.  We run inside
``container=pressure-vessel`` so umu skips that path.

The fix: game windows (WM_CLASS = "steam_app_<appid>") appear on display ``:0``
(the gamescope compositor), not ``:1``.  Setting STEAM_GAME=<appid> on them
causes gamescope to add the app to FOCUSABLE_APPS and switch focus immediately.

# How a COMPANION (trainer / cheat tool) window is tagged once identified.
# The main game window is always tagged with its real appid regardless.
#
# All three values have now been measured on-device with a trainer running
# alongside Ghost of Tsushima in Gaming Mode:
#
#   "fake"  — tag with the companion's own dedicated fake appid. gamescope
#             does not composite the window AT ALL: the trainer is simply
#             not on screen. An appid Steam does not know never enters the
#             focusable-app list gamescope receives FROM Steam
#             (``ctxFocusControlAppIDs`` in ``pick_primary_focus_and_override``),
#             so no fake VALUE can ever work — the earlier suspicion that
#             this was a signed-vs-unsigned range problem was wrong, a
#             value safely inside the positive int32 range behaved
#             identically.
#   "game"  — tag with the main game's real appid. Both windows exist, but
#             gamescope's focus picker paints only one window per appid, so
#             the trainer covers the game (or vice versa) with no way to
#             switch between them; closing the front one reveals the other.
#   "skip"  — leave the companion window WITHOUT a STEAM_GAME property.
#             This reproduces what the committed pre-companion tagger did
#             implicitly: it only ever matched on WM_CLASS, so a companion
#             window that did not carry the game's ``steam_app_<appid>``
#             WM_CLASS was ignored entirely.
#
# CRUCIAL CONTEXT for the table above: all three of those results were
# measured while the launcher had ESCAPED Steam's pressure-vessel container
# (``bin/unifideck-launcher``'s ``_escape_pressure_vessel``, which fires
# whenever Force-Compat is still set on the shortcut at launch time). The
# escape re-parents the whole real process tree — launcher, umu, game and
# companion — out from under Steam's ``reaper`` and onto
# ``steam-runtime-launcher-service``. Steam then no longer recognises those
# windows as belonging to the app it launched, and offers no way to switch
# between them, which is what made this look like an appid problem for so
# long.
#
# Launched WITHOUT the container (Force-Compat cleared, so Steam runs the
# launcher natively — the path ``selector.py`` documents as the intended
# one), Steam offers its OWN "switch window" control for the app and both
# the game and an entirely UNTAGGED companion window are reachable through
# it. That is why "skip" is the default: with a correct, non-escaped launch
# no tagging of the companion is needed at all, and adding any makes things
# worse rather than better.
#
# Note that "skip" is an EXPLICIT decision, not a fall-through: without an
# explicit companion branch, a companion window drops to the WM_CLASS rule
# and — since companions inherit the game's ``SteamAppId`` and therefore its
# WM_CLASS — gets tagged "game" anyway. That silent fall-through is what
# made every earlier fake-appid attempt a no-op, so the branch stays even
# where its outcome would coincide.
_COMPANION_TAG_MODE = "skip"


# PIDs of companion-executable process TREES (trainers, cheat tools) for
# THIS launch, mapped to the DEDICATED fake Steam appid computed for that
# specific companion (see ``launcher.proton.infrastructure.companions``). A
# companion's window has no ``steam_app_<appid>`` WM_CLASS of its own — it's
# a separate exe with its own arbitrary window class — so matching by
# PROCESS ANCESTRY (see :func:`_pid_descends_from`) is the only way to find
# its window at all.
#
# An earlier revision tagged a matched companion window with the MAIN
# GAME's own appid, on the theory that gamescope would then treat it as
# "the same app" and let the Steam button cycle to it. On-device testing
# showed that theory wrong: gamescope's focus picker
# (``pick_primary_focus_and_override`` in steamcompmgr) selects exactly ONE
# window as ``focusWindow`` for a given appid — a second top-level window
# sharing that appid is never painted at all (not merely hidden) until the
# first one unmaps. That is exactly the "trainer only appears once the game
# closes" symptom this section fixes. Tagging each companion with its OWN
# dedicated appid instead makes gamescope treat it as a genuinely separate
# focusable app — reachable independently via the Steam button's app
# switcher — while it still runs in the identical Proton prefix/env as the
# main game (only the focus-identity env vars differ; see
# ``companions._run_one_companion``).
#
# One process per launcher process (``unifideck-launcher`` is a fresh
# process per launch), so a plain module-level dict + lock is sufficient.

_companion_pid_appids: dict[int, int] = {}

# Companion EXECUTABLE BASENAMES (lower-cased, e.g. ``trainer.exe``) mapped
# to the same dedicated fake appid as ``_companion_pid_appids``.
#
# This exists because ancestry matching alone DOES NOT WORK, as proven by an
# on-device process tree: we register the PID of the ``proton runinprefix``
# process we spawn, but the Wine process that actually OWNS the trainer's
# window is REPARENTED OUT of that subtree — its PPID is 1 / systemd, not
# our proton process. Concretely, with the trainer's window owned by PID
# 7098 and our registered companion PID being 7095, ``_ancestor_chain(7098)``
# yielded ``[7098, 1398]`` and terminated: 7095 never appeared, so
# :func:`_companion_appid_for_pid` always returned ``None``.
#
# The consequence was silent and exactly matched the long-standing bug
# report: rule 1 in :func:`_try_tag` never fired for a companion, the
# window fell through to the WM_CLASS rule, and — because a companion
# inherits the main game's ``SteamAppId`` and therefore gets the identical
# ``steam_app_<appid>`` WM_CLASS — it was tagged with the MAIN GAME's
# appid. Two top-level windows then shared one ``STEAM_GAME`` value, and
# gamescope's focus picker paints only one window per value, so the trainer
# stayed invisible until the game's window unmapped. No fake-appid VALUE
# could ever fix that, because the fake appid was never applied at all.
#
# Matching on the executable basename found in ``/proc/<pid>/cmdline``
# survives the reparent because it is a property of the process itself
# rather than of its (mutable) place in the process tree.

         own dedicated appid (never the main game's — see the module-level
         ``_companion_pid_appids`` comment for why sharing the game's appid
         breaks gamescope's focus picker).
      2. Fallback: that process descends from a PID registered via
         :func:`register_companion_pid`. Kept only for companions whose
         window process is NOT reparented away from us; it cannot be the
         primary rule, since a reparent is the normal Wine behaviour (see
         ``_companion_exe_appids``'s comment for the measured evidence).
      3. Only if neither companion rule matched: WM_CLASS matches the main
         game (the original behaviour) — tagged with the main game's
         ``appid`` param.

    ORDER MATTERS: a companion process inherits the main game's own
    ``SteamAppId``/``SteamGameId`` env vars (deliberately — see
    ``companions.start_companions``'s comment for why popping or
    overriding them regressed gamescope refusing to composite the window
    at all), so Wine gives its window the SAME ``steam_app_<main game>``
    WM_CLASS as the real game window. WM_CLASS therefore CANNOT tell the
    two apart and must stay the last resort: whenever it ran first, a
    companion window was claimed as the main game's own window and got the
    game's appid, leaving gamescope with two identically-tagged windows and
    painting only one — the trainer stayed hidden until the game's window
    closed. Both companion rules run before it so that only a window from
    a process that is NOT a registered companion can reach rule 3.

    The per-window result is logged with the rule that matched, so a future
    "trainer window not focusable" report can be diagnosed from the launch
    log alone instead of needing a live process tree off the device.
