"""RPC mixin classes — alternative composition path to handler groups.

OP-26 | py_modules/unifideck/rpc/mixins/__init__.py

The mixins are the **older** composition style for the RPC
surface: each one declares a few methods that get mixed into
the plugin class via multiple inheritance, rather than being
attached at runtime via ``composer.bind_handlers``.

Both styles coexist in v1.3 for migration reasons; new RPC
methods should be added to a handler group (``handlers/``)
rather than a mixin. The mixins remain wired in for backward
compatibility with code that already imports them.

Per-mixin scope:

* ``ActionRPCMixin``         — ``unifideck://`` URI dispatch;
* ``CloudFailureRPCMixin``   — cloud-failure UX configuration;
* ``CompanionExecutablesRPCMixin`` — per-game companion-exe (trainer) list;
* ``ConfigValidationRPCMixin`` — config-validation status;
* ``DownloadRPCMixin``       — download-queue management;
* ``GameEnvRPCMixin``        — general per-game environment-variable overrides;
* ``LaunchRPCMixin``         — launch / circuit breaker;
* ``ObservabilityRPCMixin``  — metrics, watchdog, replay;
* ``OptiScalerRPCMixin``     — per-game Frame Generation (OptiScaler) patch;
* ``PlaytimeRPCMixin``       — per-game playtime stats;
* ``SecurityRPCMixin``       — audit log + brute-force state;
* ``StoreRPCMixin``          — auth + login state;
* ``SyncRPCMixin``           — library sync + game info;
* ``UIRPCMixin``             — Steam-UI manipulation + locale.

Re-exports every mixin class as a public name.
