"""OptiScalerRPCMixin — patch/unpatch Frame Generation (OptiScaler) per game.

Powers the "Frame Generation (OptiScaler)…" item injected into the native
game context menu. Replaces the broken
workflow of pasting Decky-Framegen's ``~/fgmod/fgmod %command%`` into a
Unifideck shortcut's Steam Launch Options: Unifideck shortcuts always point
``Exe`` at ``bin/unifideck-launcher`` with ``"<store>:<game_id>"`` in
``LaunchOptions`` (see ``services.shortcut.reconcile_phases._build_shortcut_entry``),
never the game's own path — so ``fgmod.sh``'s ``*.exe`` argv-sniffing (see its
source, ``fgmod.sh``) never finds a match, and its ``STEAM_COMPAT_INSTALL_PATH``
fallback isn't populated at that point either (Steam launches the launcher
script directly, not through Proton, so that var is never set for it). Users
reported DLSS/FSR files landing next to the launcher script instead of in the
game folder, or the game simply not being found at all by the plugin's
auto-detection.

Unifideck already knows the correct install directory (games.map ``work_dir``,
the same helper ``ExecutableRPCMixin`` uses) — so this mixin calls the SAME
``~/fgmod/fgmod`` wrapper Decky-Framegen installs, but passes that directory
directly as its one argument (the "standalone" invocation path in
``fgmod.sh`` — ``if [[ $# -eq 1 ]] ... exe_folder_path=$1``), skipping the
broken argv-sniffing entirely. Decky-Framegen itself remains required — this
mixin never downloads or bundles OptiScaler/DLSS-Enabler; it only detects
that ``~/fgmod/fgmod`` exists and drives it with the right path.

The patch/unpatch/status target directory is the ``.exe``'s OWN folder
(``_patch_target_dir``), not necessarily games.map's ``work_dir`` install
root — some installs extract into a nested subfolder repeating the title
(``Ghost.of.Tsushima/Ghost.of.Tsushima/…``), and Windows only searches the
launched EXE's own directory for DLLs, not the install root. Patching at
``work_dir`` in that case silently drops the DLSS-Enabler DLLs one level too
high, where the game process never finds them, even though fgmod itself
reports success. ``_patch_target_dir`` prefers the games.map row's ``exe``
column (same ground truth ``ExecutableRPCMixin`` uses) and falls back to
``work_dir`` only when no resolvable exe exists yet.

Both subprocess calls (``fgmod`` and the uninstaller) run ``bash`` scripts
inside the Decky plugin's own PyInstaller-frozen process, whose
``os.environ`` carries a poisoned ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``/``LD_PRELOAD`` (see
``sanitize_frozen_loader_env`` — the same pollution that broke every
GOG/Amazon/Ubisoft launch before it was fixed there). Left untouched, that
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` shadows the system's own ``libreadline``, and ``bash``
itself fails to start: ``bash: symbol lookup error: bash: undefined symbol:
rl_trim_arg_from_keyseq`` (rc=127) — observed in the field on every patch
attempt. Both subprocess environments are sanitized before use for this
reason.

fgmod version drift: Decky-Framegen's ``fgmod``/``fgmod-uninstaller.sh`` have
been rewritten upstream since this mixin was first written against the
public ``fgmod.sh`` source. The OLD version wrote a single fixed marker
(``dlss-enabler.dll``) and dropped a per-game ``fgmod-uninstaller.sh`` copy
into the patched folder. CURRENT installs instead write a whole different
set of files (``OptiScaler.ini``, ``fakenvapi.*``, ``D3D12_Optiscaler/``,
...) and ship exactly ONE shared uninstaller script in ``~/fgmod/`` — no
per-game copy at all. A status/uninstall check hardcoded to the old
single-marker convention silently went stale: fgmod itself logged a
successful patch, but this mixin kept reporting "not patched" and offering
"Patch" instead of "Remove patch". ``_is_patched``/``_resolve_uninstaller``
now check every fingerprint either generation is known to leave, so both
old and current fgmod installs are recognised correctly.

One env-var config surface, not two: earlier revisions of this mixin had
their OWN ``games.<store>:<game_id>.optiscaler_env`` config key + a
dedicated env editor inside this modal, separate from the general
"Environment variables…" item (``GameEnvRPCMixin``). Two places to set env
vars for the same game was confusing (which one applies where?) and
OptiScaler's own env-var convention (``Section_Option=value``, see
Decky-Framegen's README) is just regular environment variables — no
different from ``MANGOHUD=1``. So ``apply_optiscaler_patch`` now reads the
SAME general overrides ``GameEnvRPCMixin`` stores and merges them into the
patch subprocess too — set them once in "Environment variables…", and they
apply to both the game's own launch AND the OptiScaler patch step.

Three RPCs:

* ``get_optiscaler_status`` — whether ``~/fgmod/fgmod`` is installed, and
  whether this game's install dir already has ANY known patch fingerprint
  (see ``_PATCH_FINGERPRINT_NAMES`` — i.e. is patched).
* ``apply_optiscaler_patch`` — run ``fgmod <install_dir>`` with this game's
  general environment-variable overrides (``GameEnvRPCMixin``) merged in.
* ``remove_optiscaler_patch`` — run the resolved uninstaller (per-game copy
  on older fgmod, the shared central script on current fgmod — see
  ``_resolve_uninstaller``).
