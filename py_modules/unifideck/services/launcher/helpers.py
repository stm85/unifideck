"""services/launcher/helpers.py — Technical primitives for launch flows.

Functions supporting the public orchestrators
(``launch_windows`` / ``launch_native``). Most take a
``LauncherService`` as first arg (``svc``). Byte-identical
behaviour to the pre-extraction versions — split out for volumetry.

``build_native_argv``/``prepare_native_env``/``restore_steam_env``/
``find_steam_runtime`` were ported in from ``launcher/flows/native.py``
(2026-07) — that module's ``native_launch`` was never actually wired
into the live dispatch chain (``LauncherService`` calls
``orchestrator.launch_native`` instead), so its DOSBox-dispatch,
chmod, Steam Runtime wrapping, and Steam-env restore had silently
never run. Ported here rather than reconnecting the dead module, to
avoid leaving two parallel native-launch implementations again.
